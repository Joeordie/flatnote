###A Simple, Stupid Notetaking Application
That relies on the user to manage data storage.

Do you use EverNote?  What about turtl.io? Maybe you use paperwork.
I've used every cloud note taking service, some are gone.  I wanted a program
that was portable, cross platform, and didn't require an internet connection.
I also wanted a humble set of features.  Finally, i wanted to be in charge
of where my data went and how it sync'd. 

So here is my architecture for the given problem: 

java = portable and cross platform
*flat* txt files = simple and small for portability
standard folder structure = no need for a database again portable and light.

Features
1. Writes Notes/Notebooks **Done!**

2. Reads Notes **Done!**

3. Sees Directory Structure  **80%**

4. Overwrite Protection **Done!**

5. Windows Friendly

6. link highlighting

7. Tagging

8. Picture file linking
